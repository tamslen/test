# Simple Objective-C Console Application

This repository contains a basic console application written in Objective-C. The application prompts the user to enter their name and then greets them.

## Objective-C Code Explanation

The main Objective-C file (`main.m`) does the following:

- Prompts the user to enter their name.
- Reads the user input from the console.
- Removes the newline character from the input.
- Greets the user using their entered name.

Feel free to modify the code or expand the application according to your requirements.

## Notes

- This is a simple console application designed for learning purposes.
- Ensure you have a suitable Objective-C compiler installed on your system.
